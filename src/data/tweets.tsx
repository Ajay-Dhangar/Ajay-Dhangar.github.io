        Works.

        I&apos;ve used Docusaurus for two websites this year, and I&apos;ve been
        very happy about the v2. Looks good, and simple to setup.

        Continue to be impressed and excited about Docusaurus v2 alpha releases.
        Already using the sidebar items generator to help monorepo workspace
        devs create their own doc pages without any configuration needed.
