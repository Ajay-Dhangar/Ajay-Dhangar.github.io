## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are the fundamental concepts that every programmer must know. They are the tools you'll use to build software systems. Data Structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Algorithms are a set of instructions to solve a problem or perform a task.
