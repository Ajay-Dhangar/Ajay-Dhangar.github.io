Data Structures and Algorithms are the building blocks of computer science. They are the tools you'll use to build software systems. This section is a collection of resources to help you understand and master Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Data Structures

1. **Arrays:** A collection of elements identified by an index or key.
2. **Linked Lists:** A collection of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
3. **Stacks:** A collection of elements with two main principle operations: push and pop.
4. **Queues:** A collection of elements with three main principle operations: enqueue, dequeue, and peek.
5. **Trees:** A collection of nodes where each node has a value and a list of references to other nodes.
6. **Graphs:** A collection of nodes with edges between (some of) them.
7. **Heaps:** A special tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.
8. **Hash Tables:** A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.


## Algorithms

1. **Searching:** Linear Search, Binary Search, Depth First Search, Breadth First Search.
2. **Sorting:** Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
3. **Dynamic Programming:** A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems.
4. **Greedy Algorithms:** A simple, intuitive algorithm that is used in optimization problems.
5. Divide and Conquer: A technique to solve problems with the following steps: Divide, Conquer, and Combine.
6. Backtracking: A general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems.
7. Bit Manipulation: A technique to perform operations at the bit-level.
8. Recursion: A technique to solve problems where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
9. Randomized Algorithms: An algorithm that employs a degree of randomness as part of its logic.
