The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller elements \'bubble\' to the top of the list. Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort. It can be practical if the input is usually in sort order but may occasionally have some out-of-order elements nearly in position.","permalink":"/code-harbor-hub/dsa/arrays/arrays-bubblesort-in-dsa"},{"id":"arrays/arrays-selectionsort-in-dsa","title":"Arrays - Selection Sort in DSA","description":"Selection Sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted. It repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and puts it at the beginning of the unsorted part. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array. The subarray which is already sorted and the remaining subarray which is unsorted. In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.","permalink":"/code-harbor-hub/dsa/arrays/arrays-selectionsort-in-dsa"},{"id":"arrays/arrays-in-dsa","title":"Arrays in Data Structures and Algorithms","description":"An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. It is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.","permalink":"/code-harbor-hub/dsa/arrays/arrays-in-dsa"}],"unlisted":false}')}}]);
