It is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.","sidebar":"codeharborhub"},"basic-concepts/space-complexity":{"id":"basic-concepts/space-complexity","title":"Space Complexity","description":"Space complexity is a measure of the amount of working storage an algorithm needs.
