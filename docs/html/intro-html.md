HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

## Why HTML?

HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.

For example, HTML elements can encapsulate text, images, or forms. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as `<img src="image.jpg" alt="image" />` and `<input type="text" />` directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as `<p>` surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

## How to use HTML?

HTML can be used in a lot of different ways. Here are a few examples:

### 1. HTML Can Create a Web Page

Now, let's create a simple HTML page. Here is an example of a simple HTML page:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="in the code editor (vscode)" label="in the code editor (vscode)">
```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

  </body>
</html>
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="in the browser (chrome)" label="in the browser (chrome)">
<BrowserWindow minHeight="300px" url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</BrowserWindow>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. HTML Can Create a Hyperlink

HTML links are hyperlinks. You can click on a link and jump to another document. When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="in the code editor (vscode)" label="in the code editor (vscode)">
```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>

    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>

    <a href="https://www.codeharborhub.live">This is a link of CodeHarborHub</a>

  </body>
</html>
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="in the browser (chrome)" label="in the browser (chrome)">
<BrowserWindow minHeight="300px" url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
    <a href="https://www.codeharborhub.live">This is a link of CodeHarborHub</a>
</BrowserWindow>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. HTML Can Create an Italic Text

HTML also defines special elements for defining text with a special meaning. HTML uses elements like `<b>` and `<i>` for formatting output, like bold or italic text.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="in the code editor (vscode)" label="in the code editor (vscode)">
```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>

    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>This is normal text - <i>This is italic text</i>.</p>

  </body>
</html>
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="in the browser (chrome)" label="in the browser (chrome)">

<BrowserWindow minHeight="300px" url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>This is normal text - <i>This is italic text</i>.</p>
</BrowserWindow>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### And many more...

HTML can be used in a lot of different ways. You can use HTML to create a web page, create a hyperlink, create an italic text, and many more. You can learn more about HTML in the [HTML Tutorial](/docs/category/html).

## History of HTML

HTML was created by <mark>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</mark> in late **1991** but was not released officially until **January 1993**. It was a simple text-based language used to create and format documents on the World Wide Web. HTML was originally developed to describe the structure of a document, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and so on. HTML was never intended to contain tags for formatting a document. HTML was intended to define the structure of a document, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and so on.
