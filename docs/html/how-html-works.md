In this tutorial, you will learn about how HTML works, How do websites work? What is a Web Browser? What is a Web Server? How does the Internet work? How does HTML work? Learn about HTML in this tutorial.

## How Do Websites Work?

A website is a collection of web pages that are stored on a web server and can be accessed by a web browser. Websites are typically accessed by typing in a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into the address bar of a web browser. The web browser then sends a request to the web server, which responds by sending the web page back to the browser. The browser then displays the web page to the user.

## What is a Web Browser?

A web browser is a software application that is used to access and view websites on the World Wide Web. Web browsers are designed to interpret and display web pages that are written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.

## What is a Web Server?

A web server is a computer that stores and serves web pages to clients over the Internet. When a user types in a URL into a web browser, the browser sends a request to the web server, which then responds by sending the web page back to the browser. Web servers are typically used to host websites and web applications.

## How Does the Internet Work?

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate with each other using a set of protocols. When you type in a URL into a web browser, the browser sends a request to a Domain Name System (DNS) server, which translates the URL into an IP address. The browser then sends a request to the web server, which responds by sending the web page back to the browser.

## How Does HTML Work?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. HTML consists of a series of elements that you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements that you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.

HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as `<img src="image.jpg" alt="image" />` and `<input type="text" />` directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as `<p>` surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML can be used in a lot of different ways. Here are a few examples:

### 1. HTML Can Create a Web Page

Now, let's create a simple HTML page. Here is an example of a simple HTML page:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="in the code editor (vscode)" label="in the code editor (vscode)">
```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

  </body>
</html>
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="in the browser (chrome)" label="in the browser (chrome)">
<BrowserWindow minHeight="300px" url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</BrowserWindow>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
